# Functional Programming in Scala, Study Group

## Intro

Learn Functional Programming the Easy Way, by working together through an
awesome book: Functional Programming in Scala (http://manning.com/bjarnason/)

## Week 1 - First Steps in Scala

The purpose of the first week is to begin with some fundamentals of Scala. But
first, you need to ensure that your environment is setup correctly. At a
minimum, you should have sbt installed. I will be periodically doing demos at
the command line, although it is possible to achieve the same functionality from
within Typesafe Activator or IntelliJ IDEA.

We'll cover a couple of topics this week:
- scala basics: http://twitter.github.io/scala_school/basics.html
- looping
- pattern matching (com.ambantis.match.patterns.scala)

Homework
- read through Chapter 1 of the book
- work through the pattern matching exercises
